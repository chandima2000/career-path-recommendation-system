# Career Path Recommendation System

This project is a Career Path Recommendation System built with a React frontend and a Django backend. The system is implemented in four main steps:

1. **User Registration and Quiz**
2. **Machine Learning Prediction**
3. **Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**
4. **Chatbot Assistant**
5. **Voice Assistant**

## Features

1. **User Registration and Quiz**
   - After successful registration, the user is redirected to the quiz page.
   - The user answers 19 quizzes.
   - The user is automatically redirected to the prediction page to see their career job role based on their answers.

2. **Machine Learning Prediction**
   - The prediction is made using a machine learning model.
   - The model suggests a career path for the user based on their quiz answers.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - If the user is not satisfied with the prediction, they can provide feedback.
   - An NLP model predicts whether the feedback is positive or negative using the NLTK library.
   - The sentiment (positive or negative) is displayed to the user.

4. **Chatbot and Voice Bot**
   - The chatbot responds to custom data queries.
   - Implemented using Google Gemini API, LangChain, and FAISS as the Vector-DB.
   - Google Gemini is used for word embeddings.
   - The voice bot is implemented with the React Speech Recognition library, FAISS DB, LangChain, and Gemini.
